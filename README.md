## Introduction
This project aims to analyze data for Zuber, a new ride-sharing service launching in Chicago. The goal is to understand passenger preferences and the influence of external factors like weather on ride frequency. The project includes parsing weather data, analyzing taxi ride data, and testing a hypothesis related to weather's impact on ride duration.

## Data Collection
Weather data for Chicago in November 2017 was extracted and organized into a structured database, including details about city neighborhoods, taxis, rides, and weather conditions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis addressed several questions:
- Number of taxi rides for each company from November 15-16, 2017.
- Rides for companies with "Yellow" or "Blue" in their names from November 1-7, 2017.
- Number of rides for Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services, the top companies in November 2017.

Visual tools like bar and pie charts were used to visualize these findings.

## Hypothesis Testing
The hypothesis tested was whether the ride duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays. The identifiers for the Loop and O'Hare neighborhoods were retrieved, and weather conditions were categorized as "Bad" (rain or storm) or "Good" (all other conditions). Rides starting in the Loop and ending at O'Hare on Saturdays were analyzed for their duration and corresponding weather conditions.

## Conclusion
The analysis identified trends and patterns in taxi rides in Chicago. The hypothesis testing provided insights into the impact of weather on ride frequency, particularly for rides from the Loop to O'Hare on rainy Saturdays. These insights will help Zuber understand passenger preferences and external factors affecting ride frequency, which is critical for their operational and marketing strategies as they launch in Chicago.
